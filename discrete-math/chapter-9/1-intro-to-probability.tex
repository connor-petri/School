\subsection{Introduction to Probability}

\paragraph*{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{sample space} is the set of all possible outcomes of a random process or experiment.
    \item An \textbf{event} is a subset of a sample space.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Probability Formula}
If $S$ is a finite sample space in which all outcomes are equally likely and $E$ is an event in $S$,
the probability of $E$, denoted $P(E)$ is:
\begin{equation*}
    P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|}
\end{equation*}
where $|E|$ is the number of outcomes in event $E$ and $|S|$ is the number of outcomes in the sample space $S$.

\subsubsection*{Theorem}
If m and n are integers such that $m \leq n$, then there are $n-m+1$ integers in the set $\{m, m+1, \ldots, n\}$.
