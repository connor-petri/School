\subsection*{Possibility Trees and Multiplication-Rule}
\hrulefill

\paragraph*{Definition}
A \textbf{possibility tree} is a graphical representation of all possible outcomes of a random process, where each branch represents a choice or event leading to further choices or outcomes.

\subsubsection*{The Multiplication Rule}
The \textbf{multiplication rule} states that if a process can be broken down into $k$ stages, where the first stage 
has $n_1$ possible outcomes, the second stage has $n_2$ possible outcomes, and so on up to the $k$-th stage with 
$n_k$ possible outcomes, then the total number of possible outcomes for the entire process is given by:
\begin{equation*}
    N = n_1 \times n_2 \times \ldots \times n_k
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection*{Permutation}
A \textbf{permutation} of a set is an arrangement of its elements in a specific order. The number of permutations of $n$ distinct objects is given by:
\begin{equation*}
    P(n) = n!
\end{equation*}
where $n!$ (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to $n$.
